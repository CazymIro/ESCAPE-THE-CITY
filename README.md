# 🌆 Escape the City

> A minimalist pixel-style platformer built with p5.js — climb, jump, and escape the shadows of the city.

## 🎮 Description

The city is dense, dark, and quiet—too quiet.  
You were never meant to stay.

Somewhere above the noise, the smoke, and the stone,  
there’s silence. There’s sky.  
You stack your way upward—alone, as the city disappears below.
